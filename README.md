# Planet-dynamics

This notebook allows you to add a few planets to an array, choosing their radious, mass, initial position and initial velocity, and subsequently runs a simulation of the dynamics of the planets, based solely on the law of gravitation of Newton.

The plot at the bottom can be made dynamics or static. In dynamic mode, the trajectories of the planets can be seen live as the simulation progresses. In static mode, only the final plot is provided, with the entire trajectory for all planets.

Static mode is quick, while dynamic mode is very slow (I could not find the time to speed it up).
