# Planet-dynamics

This repo contains code to simulate planet dynamics. llows you to add a few planets to an array, choosing their radious, mass, initial position, initial velocity and initial acceleration, and subsequently runs a simulation of the dynamics of the planets, based solely on the law of gravitation of Newton.

The code is presented in two format: a bunch of python files (to open in an IDE) and a Jupyter notebook. While running the solution on an IDE shows the animation rather quickly, the notebook is very slow due to the constant rendering of the graph. For this reason, the notebook version has a setting to make the plot dynamics or static. In dynamic mode, the trajectories of the planets can be seen live as the simulation progresses. In static mode, only the final plot is provided, with the entire trajectory for all planets.
